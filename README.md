A BetterDiscord plugin for an MSN chat style experience (you will need to install https://betterdiscord.app/)

It is advisable not to use this as a permanent skin/theme for Discord - it is quite buggy and only put together as a small experiment/fun nostalgic experience.

Caveats: This is terribly written and hacked together with little regard for style, design patterns or longevity!

## Warning

BetterDiscord plugins can be dangerous as the author has access to the Node runtime - please review code that you're running before putting it into your discord plugins.

## Installation

Navigate to **Plugins** under the BetterDiscord settings and ensure the plugin is enabled:
